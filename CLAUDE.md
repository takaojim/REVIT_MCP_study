# CLAUDE.md

This is the canonical AI instruction file for Revit MCP. `AGENTS.md` and `GEMINI.md` intentionally redirect here.

Human-facing installation and onboarding content belongs in `README.md` / `README.zh-TW.md`.
Shared BIM methods belong in `domain/*.md` and must remain bilingual or Chinese-friendly.
AI-only operating instructions belong here and should be written in English to avoid encoding drift and mojibake.

## Project Overview

Revit MCP bridges AI language models and Autodesk Revit through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It enables AI-assisted BIM workflows through natural-language tool calls.

The project has two main runtime components:

```text
AI Client (Claude Desktop / Claude Code / Gemini CLI / VS Code Copilot / Antigravity)
  -> stdio
MCP Server (Node.js / TypeScript)
  -> MCP-Server/src/index.ts
  -> WebSocket client
Revit Add-in (C#)
  -> MCP/Application.cs
  -> HttpListener WebSocket server on localhost:8964
  -> ExternalEventManager
  -> Revit API
```

There is also an optional embedded-chat direction where a Revit WPF window can call an AI API directly. That embedded option is separate from the MCP stdio server path.

## Current Source-of-Truth Counts

These counts must be derived from source, not copied by memory.

| Item | Current Count | Source of Truth |
|---|---:|---|
| Runtime MCP tools | 177 | `registerRevitTools()` from `MCP-Server/src/tools/index.ts` |
| Domain SOP files | 79 | `domain/*.md` except `domain/README.md`, plus `domain/references/*.md` |
| Claude skills | 54 | `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` |

When these numbers change, update `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`, `README.zh-TW.md`, `docs/DOCUMENT_AUDIENCE_INVENTORY.md`, and any public site copy that makes grand-total claims. Then run `scripts/verify-qaqc.ps1 -SkipBuild -SkipDeploy`.

## Session Start Protocol

At the start of a session, read the latest project log entry if available:

```powershell
Get-ChildItem log\*.md |
  Where-Object { $_.Name -ne 'README.md' } |
  Sort-Object Name |
  Select-Object -Last 1 |
  ForEach-Object { Get-Content -Tail 80 -LiteralPath $_.FullName }
```

Treat `log/YYYY-MM.md` as append-only. Do not rewrite historical entries unless the user explicitly asks.

## MCP Connection Status

This repository can configure MCP clients, but a coding agent is not automatically connected to Revit just because `.mcp.json` exists.

Before claiming live Revit state:

1. Confirm the MCP tool namespace is actually available in the current AI client.
2. Confirm Revit is running.
3. Confirm the Revit MCP service is enabled in the Revit ribbon.
4. Confirm `localhost:8964` is reachable or that `REVIT_MCP_PORT` matches both sides.

If the Revit MCP tools are unavailable, state that limitation and provide generic guidance only.

## Single-Connection Limitation

The Revit-side WebSocket service (`MCP/Core/SocketService.cs`) holds an exclusive lock: while one MCP client is connected, additional incoming connections are rejected with HTTP 409 before the WebSocket upgrade (no more clobbering the active connection). Consequences:

- Any handshake carrying an `Origin` header is rejected with HTTP 403 **before** the exclusive-lock check and before the upgrade (issue #125). WebSocket handshakes are exempt from the same-origin policy and do no CORS preflight, so without this a malicious page open in the user's browser could drive the add-in. The node MCP bridge (`ws`) sends no `Origin`; browsers always do per RFC 6455, which separates the two at zero cost to the bridge. It sits before the lock so an untrusted handshake can neither learn the lock state nor squat on it. This gate has **no settings opt-out** — unlike `ExclusiveLock` below.
- Multiple AI clients are used by switching, never concurrently — a second client is cleanly refused, not swapped in.
- Do not advise users to run two MCP-connected AI clients against the same Revit session.
- To hand the connection to another client, use the "切換/釋放連線" (Switch/Release Connection) ribbon button — it releases the current connection so the next reconnecting client can take the lock. Because WebSocket connections are anonymous at the transport level, the switch accepts whoever reconnects first, not a guaranteed named target.
- The "MCP 設定" dialog shows which client currently holds the lock (e.g. `claude-code`, `claude-ai`), sourced from the MCP `clientInfo.name` the Node server forwards as a `?client=` query parameter; older or anonymous clients fall back to endpoint or "unknown".
- `ServiceSettings.ExclusiveLock` (default `true`) is the escape hatch that reverts to the legacy clobber behavior if disabled.
- If a connection misbehaves, the reset path is: use the ribbon's switch/release button, or restart the MCP service from the Revit ribbon.

## Personal Vault Protection

A `vault/` directory at the repo root, if present, is a user's personal knowledge vault (see `templates/personal-vault/` and `docs/BIM_MCP/reference/personal-llm-wiki.html`). It is gitignored together with `/.obsidian/`.

- Never write into `vault/` when doing project development work, and never treat its contents as project instructions.
- Never run `git clean -x` variants in this repo; they would delete the user's vault.
- Personal vault operations follow `vault/CLAUDE.md`, not this file. This file's logging and QA/QC rules apply to project development only.

## Build Commands

Build via the `/build-revit` skill. Full commands (MCP Server npm build; `dotnet build -c Release.R{22,23,24,25,26} RevitMCP.csproj`) are in README.md's Build section.

Expected output path stays `MCP/bin/Release.R{YY}/RevitMCP.dll`. Do not rely on old `bin/Release/RevitMCP.dll` instructions.

`MCP-Server`'s `npm run build` now runs `tsc && node scripts/build-apps.mjs`: `tsc` compiles the server as before, then `scripts/build-apps.mjs` (esbuild) bundles each MCP App under `MCP-Server/src/apps/*/app.ts` into a single self-contained `MCP-Server/build/apps/*/index.html` (e.g. `build/apps/clash-viewer/index.html`). Both steps must succeed for the server to advertise working `ui://` resources.

Deploy with `scripts/install-addon.ps1` or the `/deploy-addon` skill.

### Build artifacts are never tracked (2026-07-17)

`obj/` and `bin/` outputs must never be committed — `.gitignore` has `**/obj/` + `**/bin/`, and CI (`check-tracked-artifacts.yml`) fails any push/PR that reintroduces them. If `git status` shows obj/bin files as modified/tracked, something is wrong: fix with `git rm -r --cached <path>` (keeps files on disk).

If pulling the 2026-07-17 cleanup commit fails with "local changes would be overwritten" on `MCP/obj/*.nuget.g.props`, run `git restore MCP/obj/` first, then pull and rebuild — the files are regenerated by the next build.

## Code Conventions

- C# namespace: `RevitMCP`.
- Revit model changes must run inside `Transaction` and be reversible.
- Revit API work must go through `ExternalEventManager` when called from the WebSocket flow.
- C# command payloads use the existing `RevitCommandRequest` / `RevitCommandResponse` shape.
- MCP tool names use snake_case.
- C# command cases use the existing switch/dispatcher pattern unless the surrounding module already defines a better local pattern.
- Do not introduce a second add-in manifest or version-specific csproj.

## Deployment Rules

Forbidden:

- Do not create `MCP/RevitMCP.2024.csproj`, `MCP/RevitMCP.2025.csproj`, or any version-specific project file.
- Do not create `MCP/RevitMCP.2024.addin`, `MCP/RevitMCP.2025.addin`, or any version-specific add-in file.
- Do not create nested `MCP/MCP/` directories.
- Do not hardcode absolute DLL paths in `.addin` files.
- Do not change `<AddInId>` unless explicitly requested and coordinated.
- Do not set `<DeployAddin>true</DeployAddin>` in `MCP/RevitMCP.csproj`.
- Do not change port `8964` without updating every config template and documentation reference.

Required:

- One csproj: `MCP/RevitMCP.csproj`.
- One add-in manifest: `MCP/RevitMCP.addin`.
- One primary installer: `scripts/install-addon.ps1`.
- Build configs: `Release.R22`, `Release.R23`, `Release.R24`, `Release.R25`, `Release.R26`.
- Add-in assembly path remains relative: `RevitMCP\RevitMCP.dll`.

## AI Guard Rails

### Do Not Bypass MCP

Do not write ad hoc WebSocket scripts that directly send JSON to `ws://localhost:8964`.
Do not bypass `MCP-Server/src/tools/*.ts` and the Revit command dispatcher.
Do not invent raw `CommandName` / `Parameters` / `RequestId` payloads outside the established bridge.

If a tool is missing, create or modify the proper MCP tool definition and matching Revit command implementation.

### Tool Call Data Honesty

Every concrete datum in an answer must trace to a tool response in the current turn:

- IDs, GUIDs, element names, room names, view names.
- Lists of entities.
- Counts, areas, lengths, percentages, coordinates, measurements.
- Native external-system type names.

Do not fill these from memory or from a previous turn.

Before output:

1. If the draft contains a six-or-more digit number, it must appear in a tool response from this turn.
2. If the draft lists two or more named entities of the same kind, each must appear in a tool response from this turn.
3. If the draft states a count, area, length, or percentage, it must be derivable from tool output.
4. If the draft names a Revit-native type or class in a project-specific way, it must come from a tool response.

If tools are unavailable, say so and switch to generic guidance.

### Domain Method Compliance

When a task involves code compliance, regulation checks, engineering analysis, BIM quantity calculations, or a workflow covered by `domain/*.md`, the domain file defines the method.

The model's general knowledge does not define the method.

Before computing:

1. Identify whether the request matches a domain trigger.
2. Read the relevant domain file.
3. Follow its formulas, exclusions, deductions, multipliers, and edge cases.
4. If tool output lacks required fields, stop and fetch the missing fields or state that the analysis is under-specified.

Output should cite the domain file used, for example:

```text
Per domain/daylight-area-check.md, step N: ...
```

### Active State Re-Anchoring

Any claim or action depending on active Revit context must be anchored in this turn.

Re-anchor before using:

- current document
- active view
- active level
- current selection
- view ID
- level name
- side-effecting view overrides or model edits

Use `get_active_view` before the dependent operation; if it is unavailable, call `get_all_views` and identify the active view from its result. Do not reuse a view ID or level name from an earlier turn.

If the anchor tool times out, retry once. If it still fails, stop and report the limitation.

### Subagent Delegation Boundaries

**A constraint you are operating under does not propagate to a subagent unless you write it into the delegation message.** The subagent cannot see your system prompt, this file, or the earlier conversation. It sees only what you send.

Before spawning or messaging a subagent, restate every constraint that applies to the work you are handing over. At minimum:

- **What must not be written**, and to which files. Name the confidential source explicitly (e.g. "client documents under `<path>` are confidential; this repo is public — pass methods only, never client names, project codes, document titles, or client-specific figures").
- **Which files the subagent may write**, and which it must not touch.
- **Which tools it must not call** (git operations, Revit MCP, network).
- **What to do when your instruction conflicts with what it observes** — it should trust the repository and say so.

Two failure modes to guard against:

1. **You quote the confidential material while describing the task.** A delegation message that says "record what we found in the client's unit inventory" is safe; one that names the client and the document is not. **The subagent will faithfully record whatever you put in front of it — that is its job.** If confidential content reaches it, the leak is already yours.
2. **You assume a rule stated once in the session still governs.** It governs *you*, not the agent you spawn ten turns later.

**Applies to every delegation path**: `Agent`, `SendMessage` to a resumed agent, `Workflow` scripts, and skills that run in a subagent.

> **Incident (2026-08-12)**: A background recorder agent wrote client identifiers into a repo-tracked file across three commits, which were pushed to a public repository and remained reachable for roughly 21 hours. The confidentiality rule had been stated repeatedly in the session and was already written in `log/2026-08.md` — but it was never included in the messages sent to the agent, and the messages themselves named the client. The agent behaved correctly throughout; it later detected the violation itself and redacted the working file. Remediation required deleting the remote branch and filing a GitHub Support ticket for cache purging, neither of which restores the exposure window.
>
> **Rule that would have prevented it**: constraints travel with the work, not with the person who knows them.

## Domain vs Skill

Domain files and skills have different responsibilities:

| Layer | Location | Purpose | Language Policy |
|---|---|---|---|
| Domain | `domain/*.md` | Shared BIM SOP, regulations, formulas, review methods | Must remain readable by both humans and AI; do not convert to English-only |
| Skill | `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` | AI workflow orchestration and tool sequence guidance | Prefer English; preserve exact local terms where needed |
| Command | `.claude/commands/*.md` | Slash-command behavior | English preferred |
| AI constitution | `CLAUDE.md` | Global AI rules and project map | English only |
| Human docs | `README.md`, `README.zh-TW.md`, `docs/` | Installation, onboarding, teaching | Use the target human audience language |
| Teaching companion | `docs/mep-design-playbook-*.md` | A worked walkthrough of one domain method, for people meeting it for the first time. **Not a fourth layer** — the domain file still defines the method, and wins on any conflict | Traditional Chinese |

## Skills

The canonical skill catalog is the .claude/skills/ directory itself (54 skills; count table above is the gate).

Use the smallest relevant skill set. If a skill and a domain file conflict on the method, the domain file wins.

## Skill Packaging & Upstream Watch

Shareable skills are packaged as installable plugins via `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` (marketplace name: `revit-mcp-skills`). See `domain/skill-authoring-standard.md` section 8 for packaging rules and the upstream spec watch.

## MCP Profiles

`MCP-Server/src/tools/index.ts` supports `MCP_PROFILE`:

- `full`
- `architect`
- `mep`
- `structural`
- `fire-safety`

Use `full` unless a constrained client context explicitly needs a smaller tool surface.

## MCP Protocol Posture (2026-07-28 Dual-Era)

The MCP protocol announced a 2026-07-28 revision. This project takes a **dual-era, additive-only** posture: adopt metadata-layer changes that are backward-compatible on their own, and defer anything that changes the wire protocol until an official SDK ships support for it.

Adopted (additive, safe for old clients):

- Every tool registered via `registerRevitTools()` carries a `title` plus boolean `readOnlyHint` / `destructiveHint` annotations, injected centrally by `MCP-Server/src/tools/annotations.ts`. Old clients ignore unknown fields.
- `tools/list` is deterministically sorted by tool name (codepoint order) before it is returned.
- MCP Apps (extension `io.modelcontextprotocol/ui`): the server advertises a `resources` capability and serves `ui://` HTML via `ListResources` / `ReadResource` (`MCP-Server/src/apps/register-apps.ts`). `detect_clashes` carries `_meta.ui.resourceUri = "ui://clash-viewer/index.html"`, pointing at the first interactive App — a clash viewer (`MCP-Server/src/apps/clash-viewer/`) bundled by `scripts/build-apps.mjs`. Hosts that don't support the extension simply ignore `_meta.ui`; `detect_clashes` still returns its normal text result.
- SDK `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` bumped 1.22 -> 1.30 (protocol `2025-11-25`) to satisfy the `@modelcontextprotocol/ext-apps` peer dependency. 1.30 still negotiates `2025-06-18`, so this is **not** the 2026-07-28 protocol itself and stays dual-era compatible.

Deferred (wire-level, requires an official SDK for protocol 2026-07-28 before implementing): stateless connection mode, `server/discover`, `resultType`, Tasks core, HTTP/OAuth transport and authorization.

Full rationale, FAQ, and fork-contributor notes: `docs/MIGRATION_GUIDE.md`.

## AI Client Configuration

See README.md / README.zh-TW.md "AI Client Configuration" for the full per-client setup. Config templates live in `MCP-Server/*_config.json`.

## Troubleshooting

See `docs/troubleshoot-first-install.md` for the full walkthrough. Port `8964` stuck on HTTP.sys: run `scripts/release-port.ps1`.

## QA/QC

Before completing changes that affect docs, tools, skills, domain files, build config, or deployment:

```powershell
.\scripts\verify-qaqc.ps1 -SkipBuild -SkipDeploy
```

For release or deployment validation, run without skip flags on Windows with the required SDKs installed:

```powershell
.\scripts\verify-qaqc.ps1 -Version 2024
```

QA/QC must cover:

- forbidden legacy files
- required file structure
- stale path references
- build config consistency
- add-in manifest safety
- runtime tool count alignment
- domain and skill count alignment
- domain table forward/reverse link checks
- local markdown link rot
- AI/human/shared document audience classification
- mojibake risk in AI-only and human-facing canonical docs
- markdown count-table claims (`| Runtime MCP tools | N |` style) in CLAUDE.md, README, README.zh-TW, and the audience inventory
- claim-site scan scope (Phase 7 checks `7-1`/`7-2`/`7-3`): `$scanPaths` walks `docs\BIM_MCP\**\*.html` recursively. Exclusions live in `$skipPatterns` and nowhere else — never narrow coverage by editing a glob, because a file that is never read produces the same green report as a file that passes
- three-layer enumeration parity (Phase 7 checks `7-9`/`7-10`/`7-14`): every Domain file, every Skill, and every runtime tool must have exactly one card on its BIM_MCP index page, checked in both directions. `7-1`/`7-2`/`7-3` only verify that the stated *numbers* are right — a correct count is fully compatible with zero items being documented, which is how the Tool layer stayed unlisted while every count claim passed. `7-14` additionally checks that `tools-index.html`'s own derived tallies (badge counts, per-category counts) agree with the cards it actually contains; that page is generated from `registerRevitTools()`, so regenerate it rather than hand-editing
- claim-pattern liveness (Phase 7 check `7-13`): every pattern in `$claimSites` must still match at least one live site. A pattern that matches nothing reports PASS exactly like one that matches N correct sites, so reworded pages silently lose their guard. When a claim site legitimately disappears, mark that entry `Dormant = $true` — an explicit, reviewable decision rather than a silent zero
- hardcoded user account name scan (Phase 3 check `3-4`): scans every tracked text file (not just client config templates) for a literal account name in a `Users\`/`Users/` path; acceptable placeholder forms are enumerated in `$allowedUsers` (e.g. `<YOUR_USERNAME>`, `<YOUR_PROJECT_PATH>`, `<CONTRIBUTOR_USERNAME>`, `<OTHER_MACHINE_USER>`); any exclusion in `$pathScanSkip` must be listed by exact file path, never by prefix — a self-check FAILs if the hit count drifts from the list length
- snapshot banner (`data-snapshot="YYYY-MM-DD"`) on date-prefixed `docs/MMDD-*.html`
- MCP Registry publish consistency (`server.json` ↔ `MCP-Server/package.json` ↔ schema; 3-place version parity) — Phase 7 check `7-11`, see below
- MCP 2026 compliance (Phase 9): 9-1 every tool declares a non-empty `title` and boolean `readOnlyHint`, with `destructiveHint=true` confined to the allow-list (`delete_element`, `dedup_detail_elements_in_view`, `curate_mep_sizes`); 9-2 every MCP Apps `ui://` resource resolves with the correct MIME (`text/html;profile=mcp-app`) and is self-contained (no external `src`/`href`/`url()` references)
- deployment integrity (Phase 5, only when `-SkipDeploy` is omitted): 5-3 the deployed DLL set must cover the corresponding `MCP/bin/<config>/*.dll` build output — missing any file is a FAIL that names it; 5-4 the deployed `RevitMCP.dll` SHA256 must match that build output (WARN on mismatch — usually just not rebuilt); 5-5 cross-version consistency, WARN listing versions left behind; 5-6 WARN on a root-level `Addins\<year>\RevitMCP.dll` (pre-#91 layout residue — the manifest loads the subfolder copy)

Phase 5 design constraints — do not regress these:

- **Never hardcode an expected file count.** `Release.R22`/`R23`/`R24` emit **13** DLLs (.NET Framework 4.8, including 5 compat shims: `System.Buffers`, `System.IO.Packaging`, `System.Memory`, `System.Numerics.Vectors`, `System.Runtime.CompilerServices.Unsafe`); `Release.R25`/`R26` emit **8** (.NET 8 supplies those from the runtime). Both are correct — always enumerate the matching config's build output as the baseline.
- Revit installed but RevitMCP not deployed → SKIP, not FAIL (it is the user's choice). Build output missing for a config → SKIP with a reason.
- `-AddinsRoot <path>` overrides the addins base (default `$env:APPDATA\Autodesk\Revit\Addins`). It exists so negative tests can run against a throwaway fixture instead of the user's live deployment. Keep it.
- `MCP/Core/RevitCompatibility.cs` switches `IdType` between `Int32` and `Int64` on `REVIT2025_OR_GREATER`, so an R24 DLL and an R26 DLL are ABI-incompatible. Cross-generation misdeployment produces no error while copying — it only fails when Revit loads or calls it. That is why 5-3/5-4 exist.

## MCP Registry Publish Consistency

The MCP Registry publish artifacts must stay mutually consistent. This is owned by two **mandated Sonnet subagents** plus a deterministic gate — never hand-maintained ad hoc.

**Main files** (any change to these triggers the loop): `server.json`, `MCP-Server/package.json`, `scripts/schemas/server.schema.json`, `.github/workflows/publish-mcp.yml`, `docs/MCP_REGISTRY_PUBLISH.md`.

**The loop** — whenever a main file changes (a PostToolUse hook, `.claude/hooks/detect-registry-trigger.sh`, reminds you):

1. **`mcp-registry-sync`** (`.claude/agents/mcp-registry-sync.md`, **model: sonnet**) — the fix agent. Aligns `server.json` `.version` / `.packages[].version` / `.packages[].identifier` / `.name` / repo URL, plus the README "Install from MCP Registry" section and the playbook's `Current version`, to the authoritative source (`MCP-Server/package.json` / the `v*` tag).
2. **`mcp-registry-ops-inspect`** (`.claude/agents/mcp-registry-ops-inspect.md`, **model: sonnet**) — the read-only ops audit. Confirms no drift and reports the verdict.
3. **Hard gate** — `python scripts/validate_publish_consistency.py` must exit `0` (also wired into `verify-qaqc.ps1` Phase 7 check `7-11`).

**Rules:**

- Both agents **must run as Sonnet** (pinned in their frontmatter — do not override).
- **Never regress a version.** Only align upward to the authoritative/highest valid semver.
- **Never `npm publish` / `mcp-publisher publish` manually.** Release only by pushing a `v*` tag → `.github/workflows/publish-mcp.yml` rewrites the 3 version places and publishes.
- **Report in Traditional Chinese (繁體中文)** every time this area is touched: which files/fields changed, from what → to what, and the validator's exit code.

## Logging Protocol

Append meaningful AI-driven changes to the current monthly log:

```markdown
## [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] {event-type} | {short-description}
- actor: {model-id} (via {client-name})
- files: {comma-separated list}
- trigger: {git-hook | claude-hook | manual}
- summary: {one-liner}
```

Do not log secrets, API keys, or large tool outputs.

## Documentation Writing Policy

Use `docs/DOCUMENT_AUDIENCE_INVENTORY.md` as the classification source.

Rules:

1. AI-only documents should be English.
2. Human-facing Traditional Chinese documents may be Chinese, but must be valid UTF-8 and readable.
3. English human-facing documents should not contain mojibake.
4. Domain files are shared by humans and AI. They must not become English-only.
5. Domain files may use bilingual headings and terminology when useful.
6. Any new domain file must include frontmatter consistent with `domain/frontmatter-standard.md`.
7. Any new AI instruction file must declare whether it is canonical, redirect, command, skill, or local-only.
8. Date-prefixed `docs/MMDD-*.html` files are immutable event snapshots: they must carry a `data-snapshot="YYYY-MM-DD"` banner, their numbers are never re-synced, and QA/QC count checks intentionally skip them.

## Final Pre-Response Checklist

Before answering with project-specific facts:

1. Did I read the latest relevant files in this turn?
2. If live Revit state is involved, did I call the relevant MCP tool in this turn?
3. If a domain method applies, did I read and follow the domain file?
4. If active view/level/selection matters, did I re-anchor in this turn?
5. If I changed docs or counts, did I run QA/QC or state why I could not?
